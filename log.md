**Today's Progress**: Forked this repositorty and read the rules thoroughly and thought about projects

**Thoughts:**  I was first white boarding ideas to showcase and prove my dailey work. As I was connecting to my repository I saw Siraj's repositorys and of course went with the flow (pun intended)

## Day 1: 
**Today's Progress**: Got my hands on a Intel Compute stick and wasted several hours trying to just install the software. The Intel stick if very picky on the Ubuntu version. I am running 18 but wants 16. The day was not all a loss I started doing Kaggles HR Analytics project to warm up to the big money competitions.

**Thoughts:**  I got alot done today on my HR project. The Dataset was cleaned and preprocessed and I ran it through a descison tree with poor results. I need to think of another algorithm to use. Maybe something Gradient or a Random Forest.

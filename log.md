## Day 0: 
**Today's Progress**: Forked this repositorty and read the rules thoroughly and thought about projects

**Thoughts:**  I was first white boarding ideas to showcase and prove my dailey work. As I was connecting to my repository I saw Siraj's repositorys and of course went with the flow (pun intended)

## Day 1: 
**Today's Progress**: Got my hands on a Intel Compute stick and wasted several hours trying to just install the software. The Intel stick if very picky on the Ubuntu version. I am running 18 but wants 16. The day was not all a loss I started doing Kaggles HR Analytics project to warm up to the big money competitions.

**Thoughts:**  I got alot done today on my HR project. The Dataset was cleaned and preprocessed and I ran it through a descison tree with poor results. I need to think of another algorithm to use. Maybe something Gradient or a Random Forest.

## Day 2: 
**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Kaggle IBM HR proect. I used gradient boosting classifier which got me in the high ninety percentile on both the training and test sets. Better results than yesterdays overfitting using a decision tree. I also played around with Seaborn with Matplotlib to view my model results better.

**Thoughts:**  After watching Siraj's new recent video on Backproppagation I had gradient decent stuck in my head, so I tried using a gradient technique for this project.

## Day 3: 
**Today's Progress**: Today was another productive day. I found a good ML dataset repostory and used a Breast Cancer Dataset to build and run a K-Nearest Nieghbor model For fun  I fitted and scored the dataset through a SVM, Random Forest and XGBoost models. I also figured out how to streamline my Exploratory Data Analysis with more logical approach to importing and assigning column labels.

**Thoughts:**  I definetly like the UCI ML repository to practice on. I am still treading on the fundamentals for now to gain some inspiration to continue my Deep Learning and Artificial Intellegence work.

## Day 4: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I used Tensorflow to add a DQN model to my AI DOOM player agent that I had built a awhile back that had orignally only used a basic score based heuristics. 

**Thoughts:**  Using Deep models and Reinforcement techniques really work great with retro games. Im wrapping my mind around more recent and advance applications.

## Day 5: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to build a RNN model without using any libraries only Numpy for the calculations. 

**Thoughts:** I really was able to wrap my mind around the inner workings of a model and especially Forward and Back propagation. Tommororw I will build an LSTM to add to it and hopfully I will be pushing some Data through it the following day.

## Day 6: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on my RNN-LSTM Network from scratch by adding the LSTM Layer.

**Thoughts**:  Im really grasping statistical thinking. Tommorrow I will try my network on some Sequential Data.

## Day 7: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I finished work on my RNN-LSTM Network from scratch by feeding 'The Goonies' movie script through it and got great predictions.

**Thoughts**:  Today was the fun part of ML being able to actually run my Model. Building models from scratch is tedious and time consuming. Unless you need to tweak some deminsion I suggest using a library.

## Day 8: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I went further.... I took a LSTM model using Keras and generated 'Metallica' style music.

**Thoughts**:  I really like the ease of libraries like Keras and Tensorflow.

## Day 9: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I made a Movie Recommender System from Scratch to brush up on my math. I only used Numpy and Scipy for importation of the data files. On a less ML note I taught a youngster about Classes and Functions in Python using the Turtle library.

**Thoughts**:  I really like the recommended movies. Its almost like my model is intuitive...

## Day 10: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I brushed up on DCGAN's by building a model with pytorch and used the cifar-10 dataset.

**Thoughts**:  It took awhile to run my model. In the future I might think about not being lazy and running my model on a cloud GPU. I also want to find a cool dataset to run through it. This might be my Finally project at the end of the 100 days.

## Day 11: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I was mostly AFK, but that didn't stop me. I read some "Hands-On Machine Learning with SciKit-Learn & TensorFlow" an O'Reilly book. My DCGAN's model is still trainning, too.

**Thoughts**:  Good book so far. It really describes Machine Algorithms in basic terms. I am excited to try the examples later in the book.

## Day 12: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I finally finished trainning my DCGAN's. I also messed around with Keras and had fun with Keras's Datasets with some basic models.

**Thoughts**:  I'm not happy with my DCGAN's results. I am leaning towards a hardware optimization problem not a Data or Model issue. Since I trainned it on my CPU rig. On a lighter note I really like the summary() print out that Keras does.

## Day 13: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I started the Metis Challenge of Naive-Bees from DataDriven on DataCamp

**Thoughts**:  I like using PIL. Opening and manipulating photo files are easy..

## Day 14: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I made a self-driving car Detector system using YOLO. I also pondered about models I can throw at the Naive-Bees challenge.

**Thoughts**: I like the YOLO algorithm over Haar, Cascading and Violo-Jones.

## Day 0: 
**Today's Progress**: Forked this repositorty and read the rules thoroughly and thought about projects

**Thoughts:**  I was first white boarding ideas to showcase and prove my dailey work. As I was connecting to my repository I saw Siraj's repositorys and of course went with the flow (pun intended)

## Day 1: 
**Today's Progress**: Got my hands on a Intel Compute stick and wasted several hours trying to just install the software. The Intel stick if very picky on the Ubuntu version. I am running 18 but wants 16. The day was not all a loss I started doing Kaggles HR Analytics project to warm up to the big money competitions.

**Thoughts:**  I got alot done today on my HR project. The Dataset was cleaned and preprocessed and I ran it through a descison tree with poor results. I need to think of another algorithm to use. Maybe something Gradient or a Random Forest.

## Day 2: 
**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Kaggle IBM HR proect. I used gradient boosting classifier which got me in the high ninety percentile on both the training and test sets. Better results than yesterdays overfitting using a decision tree. I also played around with Seaborn with Matplotlib to view my model results better.

**Thoughts:**  After watching Siraj's new recent video on Backproppagation I had gradient decent stuck in my head, so I tried using a gradient technique for this project.

## Day 3: 
**Today's Progress**: Today was another productive day. I found a good ML dataset repostory and used a Breast Cancer Dataset to build and run a K-Nearest Nieghbor model For fun  I fitted and scored the dataset through a SVM, Random Forest and XGBoost models. I also figured out how to streamline my Exploratory Data Analysis with more logical approach to importing and assigning column labels.

**Thoughts:**  I definetly like the UCI ML repository to practice on. I am still treading on the fundamentals for now to gain some inspiration to continue my Deep Learning and Artificial Intellegence work.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/HvyD/Generating-Metallica-style-music-with-a-LSTM



## Day 9: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I made a Movie Recommender System from Scratch to brush up on my math. I only used Numpy and Scipy for importation of the data files. On a less ML note I taught a youngster about Classes and Functions in Python using the Turtle library.

**Thoughts**:  I really like the recommended movies. Its almost like my model is intuitive...

**Link to work**: https://github.com/HvyD/Movie-Recommender-System



## Day 10: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I brushed up on DCGAN's by building a model with pytorch and used the cifar-10 dataset.

**Thoughts**:  It took awhile to run my model. In the future I might think about not being lazy and running my model on a cloud GPU. I also want to find a cool dataset to run through it. This might be my Finally project at the end of the 100 days.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/HvyD/MLB-Team-Win-Predictor



## Day 24: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to make lemonade out of all the rejection letters I have recieved this past year. I scraped all my rejection emails into a .CSV file and after exploring and feature selection I ran it through some NLP techniques on it pulling different comparisons. Showcasing with plots and WordClouds.  Lastly I ran the dataset through a RandomForest and AdaBoost model's. All this to poke fun at all the companies who declined my services.

**Thoughts**:  I found some new and cool functions with Pandas and had fun making WordClouds...

## Day 26: 
**Today's Progress**: Today during an interview I had a question I was asked of what would be the best way to detect street signs for a SDC. I went back and forth on my decision but really like YOLO. So when I got off the phone I made a YOLO Traffic Sign Detector to try and prove what I felt was a correct answer.

**Thoughts**:  Dabbled with MXNET and thought it was cool...

**Link to work**: https://github.com/HvyD/YOLO-Traffic-Sign-Detector



## Day 27: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on some NLP making a Sentiment Analysis model on Hotel Reviews since its that time of year that my family wants to go vacationing and my computer needed a rest from doing Computer Vision.

**Thoughts**:  Tried different models and was suprised that the best results came from a simple SVM.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/HvyD/Sentiment-Analysis-on-Hotel-Reviiews

## Day 37: 
**Today's Progress**: On vacation with the family at Legoland inspired me to make a Lego recognizer.

**Thoughts**:  Very basic since Im vacationing but when I get home I plain to train it as CV not on basic ML models.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/HvyD/Basic-Lego-Recognizer




## Day 38: 
**Today's Progress**: Wrapping up vacationing with the family at Legoland I started adding the CV component to the Lego recognizer I began building yesterday. I decided to use a Convolutional Neural Network model on the Lego brick dataset.

**Thoughts**: Just added the code. I cant wait to get home and debug and train my model.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/HvyD/Basic-Lego-Recognizer




## Day 39: 
**Today's Progress**:  This was one long and crappy day. I trained the Lego Recognizer Model on AWS since I was stuck at the airport due to flight delays and then cancellation. My model first overfitted on an embarrassing level, then I was only able to achieve about 60 percent efficiency. My model only got 6 out 10 correct. 

**Thoughts**: Note to self... When on vacation no more coding...

**Link to work**: https://github.com/HvyD/Basic-Lego-Recognizer





## Day 40: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I tweeked on my Lego Recognizer and brought my efficiency up to 80 percent. 8 out of 10 correctly guessed. I also finally recieved and started reading Francios Chollet book "Deep Learning with Python" from Manning Publications.

**Thoughts**: I am excited to begin reading this new book.

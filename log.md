**Link to work:** https://github.com/HvyD/100-days-of-code


## Day 1: 
**Today's Progress**: Got my hands on a Intel Compute stick and wasted several hours trying to just install the software. The Intel stick if very picky on the Ubuntu version. I am running 18 but wants 16. The day was not all a loss I started doing Kaggles HR Analytics project to warm up to the big money competitions.

**Thoughts:**  I got alot done today on my HR project. The Dataset was cleaned and preprocessed and I ran it through a descison tree with poor results. I need to think of another algorithm to use. Maybe something Gradient or a Random Forest.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/HvyD/Kaggle---IBM-Analytics/blob/master/IBM%20HR%20Analytics%20Project.ipynb


## Day 2: 
**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Kaggle IBM HR proect. I used gradient boosting classifier which got me in the high ninety percentile on both the training and test sets. Better results than yesterdays overfitting using a decision tree. I also played around with Seaborn with Matplotlib to view my model results better.

**Thoughts:**  After watching Siraj's new recent video on Backproppagation I had gradient decent stuck in my head, so I tried using a gradient technique for this project.

## Day 90: 
**Today's Progress**: I finished running and de-bugging the Anime GAN's model I implemented yesterday. I also re-read GoodFellows paper on GAN's to fully grasp my model. 

**Thoughts**: Nice mellow day wacthing my Models run. I ran it on my old gen. i5 instead of dropping money or any credits on AWS.

## Day 91: 
**Today's Progress**: While at my local library looking at books for my child I ran across "TensorFlow for Dummies". I couldn't resist like a slowing down and looking at an accident. To my amazement the content went really deep. It went into perceptrons and exampled models from Squeezenet to ACGANS. I successfully implemented a few of the Models myself out of curiousity, due to the way the authur stacked his code. 

**Thoughts**: Sometimes the weirdest things pop up at you in lifw when your not looking for them.

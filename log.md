## Day 0: 
**Today's Progress**: Forked this repositorty and read the rules thoroughly and thought about projects

**Thoughts:**  I was first white boarding ideas to showcase and prove my dailey work. As I was connecting to my repository I saw Siraj's repositorys and of course went with the flow (pun intended)

## Day 1: 
**Today's Progress**: Got my hands on a Intel Compute stick and wasted several hours trying to just install the software. The Intel stick if very picky on the Ubuntu version. I am running 18 but wants 16. The day was not all a loss I started doing Kaggles HR Analytics project to warm up to the big money competitions.

**Thoughts:**  I got alot done today on my HR project. The Dataset was cleaned and preprocessed and I ran it through a descison tree with poor results. I need to think of another algorithm to use. Maybe something Gradient or a Random Forest.

## Day 2: 
**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Kaggle IBM HR proect. I used gradient boosting classifier which got me in the high ninety percentile on both the training and test sets. Better results than yesterdays overfitting using a decision tree. I also played around with Seaborn with Matplotlib to view my model results better.

**Thoughts:**  After watching Siraj's new recent video on Backproppagation I had gradient decent stuck in my head, so I tried using a gradient technique for this project.

## Day 3: 
**Today's Progress**: Today was another productive day. I found a good ML dataset repostory and used a Breast Cancer Dataset to build and run a K-Nearest Nieghbor model For fun  I fitted and scored the dataset through a SVM, Random Forest and XGBoost models. I also figured out how to streamline my Exploratory Data Analysis with more logical approach to importing and assigning column labels.

**Thoughts:**  I definetly like the UCI ML repository to practice on. I am still treading on the fundamentals for now to gain some inspiration to continue my Deep Learning and Artificial Intellegence work.

## Day 4: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I used Tensorflow to add a DQN model to my AI DOOM player agent that I had built a awhile back that had orignally only used a basic score based heuristics. 

**Thoughts:**  Using Deep models and Reinforcement techniques really work great with retro games. Im wrapping my mind around more recent and advance applications.

## Day 5: 
**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to build a RNN model without using any libraries only Numpy for the calculations. 

**Thoughts:** I really was able to wrap my mind around the inner workings of a model and especially Forward and Back propagation. Tommororw I will build an LSTM to add to it and hopfully I will be pushing some Data through it the following day.
